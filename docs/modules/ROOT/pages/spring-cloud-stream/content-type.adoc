= Content Type Negotiation

Data transformation is one of the core features of any message-driven microservice architecture. Given that, in Spring Cloud Stream, such data
is represented as a Spring `Message`, a message may have to be transformed to a desired shape or size before reaching its destination. This is required for two reasons:

. To convert the contents of the incoming message to match the signature of the application-provided handler.

. To convert the contents of the outgoing message to the wire format.

The wire format is typically `byte[]` (that is true for the Kafka and Rabbit binders), but it is governed by the binder implementation.

In Spring Cloud Stream, message transformation is accomplished with an `org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter`.
