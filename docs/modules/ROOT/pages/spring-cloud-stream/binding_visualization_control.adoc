[[binding_visualization_control]]
= Binding visualization and control

Spring Cloud Stream supports visualization and control of the Bindings through Actuator endpoints as well as programmatic way.

[[programmatic-way]]
== Programmatic way

Since version 3.1 we expose `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binding.BindingsLifecycleController` which is registered as bean and once 
injected could be used to control the lifecycle of individual bindings

For example, looks at the fragment from one of the test cases. As you can see we retrieve `BindingsLifecycleController` 
from spring application context and execute individual methods to control the lifecycle of `echo-in-0` binding..

[source,java]
----
BindingsLifecycleController bindingsController = context.getBean(BindingsLifecycleController.class);
Binding binding = bindingsController.queryState("echo-in-0");
assertThat(binding.isRunning()).isTrue();
bindingsController.changeState("echo-in-0", State.STOPPED);
//Alternative way of changing state. For convenience we expose start/stop and pause/resume operations.
//bindingsController.stop("echo-in-0")
assertThat(binding.isRunning()).isFalse();
----

=== Define new and manage existing bindings

Additionally, starting version 4.2 using `BindingsLifecycleController` you can define new bindings as well as modify existing bindings configuration by accessing 
its Consumer and Producer configuration properties for more dynamic management of its values. 

For example.

To define new input binding you can call `BindingsLifecycleController.defineInputBinding(..)` method (see below). There is equivalent of `defineOutputBinding(..)` method.

[source,java]
----
BindingsLifecycleController controller = context.getBean(BindingsLifecycleController.class);
KafkaConsumerProperties consumerProperties = controller.defineInputBinding("test-input-binding"); 
----

You can than manage its properties by calling `getExtensionProperties(..)` method.

[source,java]
----
KafkaConsumerProperties properties = controller.getExtensionProperties("test-input-binding‚Äù);

----

NOTE: Unlike binding names derived from function definition, explicitly defined bindings do not carry the `in-0/out-0` suffix since they are not backed by an actual function. 

The `getExtensionProperties(..)` operation is defined to ensure you get the proper type of the configuration properties class, so depending on the binder and binding used you can safely cast your extension properties to appropriate type. In our case it is `KafkaConsumerProperties` properties. 

NOTE: Depending on the type of property you change, you may need to re-start the binding for it to take effect (ass seen earlier)

[[actuator]]
== Actuator
Since actuator and web are optional, you must first add one of the web dependencies as well as add the actuator dependency manually.
The following example shows how to add the dependency for the Web framework:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The following example shows how to add the dependency for the WebFlux framework:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

You can add the Actuator dependency as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: To run Spring Cloud Stream 2.0 apps in Cloud Foundry, you must add `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to the classpath. Otherwise, the
application will not start due to health check failures.

You must also enable the `bindings` actuator endpoints by setting the following property: `--management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=bindings`.

Once those prerequisites are satisfied. you should see the following in the logs when application start:

	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[POST]. . .
	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings],methods=[GET]. . .
	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[GET]. . .

To visualize the current bindings, access the following URL:
`http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings`

Alternative, to see a single binding, access one of the URLs similar to the following:
`http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/<bindingName>`

You can also stop, start, pause, and resume individual bindings by posting to the same URL while providing a `state` argument as JSON, as shown in the following examples:

    curl -d '{"state":"STOPPED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"STARTED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"PAUSED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"RESUMED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName

NOTE: `PAUSED` and `RESUMED` work only when the corresponding binder and its underlying technology supports it. Otherwise, you see the warning message in the logs.
Currently, only Kafka and [Solace](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-spring-cloud/tree/master/solace-spring-cloud-starters/solace-spring-cloud-stream-starter#consumer-bindings-pauseresume) binders supports the `PAUSED` and `RESUMED` states.

[[sanitize-sensitive-data]]
=== Sanitize Sensitive Data

When using the binding actuator endpoint, it is sometimes critical to sanitize any sensitive data such as user credentials, information about SSL keys, etc.
To achieve this, end user applications can provide a `SanitizingFunction` from Spring Boot as a bean in the application.
Here is an example to scramble the data when providing a value for Apache Kafka's `sasl.jaas.config` property.

```
@Bean
public SanitizingFunction sanitizingFunction() {
	return sanitizableData -> {
		if (sanitizableData.getKey().equals("sasl.jaas.config")) {
			return sanitizableData.withValue("data-scrambled!!");
		}
		else {
			return sanitizableData;
		}
	};
}
```
