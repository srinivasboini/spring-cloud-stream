As stated earlier, _Bindings_ provide a bridge between the external messaging system (e.g., queue, topic etc.) and application-provided _Producers_ and _Consumers_.

The following example shows a fully configured and functioning Spring Cloud Stream application that receives the payload of the message
as a `String` type (see xref:spring-cloud-stream/content-type.adoc#content_type_management[Content Type Negotiation] section), logs it to the console and sends it down stream after converting it to upper case.

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SampleApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	    return value -> {
	        System.out.println("Received: " + value);
	        return value.toUpperCase();
	    };
	}
}
----
The above example looks no different than any vanilla spring-boot application. It defines a single bean of type `Function`
and that is it. So, how does it become a spring-cloud-stream application?
It becomes a spring-cloud-stream application simply because of the presence of spring-cloud-stream and binder dependencies
and auto-configuration classes on the classpath, effectively setting the context for your boot application as a spring-cloud-stream application.
And in this context beans of type `Supplier`, `Function` or `Consumer` are treated as defacto message handlers triggering
binding of to destinations exposed by the provided binder following certain naming conventions and
rules to avoid extra configuration.
