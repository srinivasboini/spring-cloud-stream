= Functional binding names

Unlike the explicit naming required by annotation-based support (legacy) used in the previous versions of spring-cloud-stream, the functional
programming model defaults to a simple convention when it comes to binding names, thus greatly simplifying application configuration.
Let's look at the first example:

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	    return value -> value.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----

In the preceding example we have an application with a single function which acts as message handler. As a `Function` it has an
input and output.
The naming convention used to name input and output bindings is as follows:

* input - `<functionName> + -in- + <index>`
* output - `<functionName> + -out- + <index>`

The `in` and `out` corresponds to the type of binding (such as _input_ or _output_).
The `index` is the index of the input or output binding. It is always 0 for typical single input/output function,
so it's only relevant for xref:spring-cloud-stream/producing-and-consuming-messages.adoc#functions_with_multiple_input_and_output_arguments[Functions with multiple input and output arguments].

So if for example you would want to map the input of this function to a remote
destination (e.g., topic, queue etc) called "my-topic" you would do so with the following property:
----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.destination=my-topic
----
Note how `uppercase-in-0` is used as a segment in property name. The same goes for `uppercase-out-0`.

***Descriptive Binding Names***

Some times to improve readability you may want to give your binding a more descriptive name (such as 'account', 'orders' etc).
Another way of looking at it is you can map an _implicit binding name_ to an _explicit binding name_. And you can do it with
`spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.<binding-name>` property.
This property also provides a migration path for existing applications that rely on custom interface-based
bindings that require explicit names.

For example,
----
--spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.uppercase-in-0=input
----

In the preceding example you mapped and effectively renamed `uppercase-in-0` binding name to `input`. Now all configuration
properties can refer to `input` binding name instead (e.g.,  `--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=my-topic`).

NOTE: While descriptive binding names may enhance the readability aspect of the configuration, they also create
another level of misdirection by mapping an implicit binding name to an explicit binding name. And since all subsequent
configuration properties will use the explicit binding name you must always refer to this 'bindings' property to
correlate which function it actually corresponds to. We believe that for most cases (with the exception of xref:spring-cloud-stream/producing-and-consuming-messages.adoc#functional-composition[Functional Composition])
it may be an overkill, so, it is our recommendation to avoid using it altogether, especially
since not using it provides a clear path between binder destination and binding name, such as `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.destination=sample-topic`,
where you are clearly correlating the input of `uppercase` function to `sample-topic` destination.
