[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling]]
= Error Handling

In this section we'll explain the general idea behind error handling mechanisms provided by the framework.
We'll be using Rabbit binder as an example, since individual binders define different set
of properties for certain supported mechanisms specific to underlying broker capabilities (such as Kafka binder).

Errors happen, and Spring Cloud Stream provides several flexible mechanisms to deal with them. Note, the techniques are dependent on binder implementation and the
capability of the underlying messaging middleware as well as programming model (more on this later).

Whenever Message handler (function) throws an exception, it is propagated back to the binder, at which point binder will make several attempts at re-trying
the same message (3 by default) using `RetryTemplate` provided by the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] library.
If retries are unsuccessful it is up to the error handling mechanism which may _drop_ the message, _re-queue_ the message for re-processing or _send the failed message to DLQ_.

Both Rabbit and Kafka support these concepts (especially DLQ). However, other binders may not, so refer to your individual binderâ€™s documentation for details on supported
error-handling options.

Keep in mind however, the _reactive function_ does NOT qualify as a Message handler, since it does not handle individual messages and 
instead provides a way to connect stream (i.e., Flux) provided by the framework with the one provided by the user. 
***Why is this important?***
That is because anything you read later in this section with regard to Retry Template, dropping failed messages, retrying, 
DLQ and configuration properties that assist with all of it ***only*** applies to Message handlers (i.e., imperative functions).

Reactive API provides a very rich library of its own operators and mechanisms to assist you with error handling specific to 
variety of reactive uses cases which are far more complex then simple Message handler cases, So use them, such 
as `public final Flux<T> retryWhen(Retry retrySpec);` that you can find in `reactor.core.publisher.Flux`.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> uppercase() {
	return flux -> flux
			.retryWhen(Retry.backoff(3, Duration.ofMillis(1000)))
			.map(v -> v.toUpperCase());
}

[[drop-failed-messages]]
== Drop Failed Messages

By default, the system provides error handlers. The first error handler will simply log error message. The second error handler is binder specific error handler 
which is responsible for handling error message in the context of a specific messaging system (e.g., send to DLQ). But since no additional error handling configuration was provided (in this current scenario) this handler will not do anything. So essentially after being logged, the message will be dropped. 

While acceptable in some cases, for most cases, it is not, and we need some recovery mechanism to avoid message loss.

[[handle-error-messages]]
== Handle Error Messages

In the previous section we mentioned that by default messages that resulted in error are effectively logged and dropped. The framework also exposes mechanism for you
to provide custom error handler (i.e., to send notification or write to database, etc). You can do so by adding `Consumer` that is specifically designed to accept `ErrorMessage` which aside from all the information about the error (e.g., stack trace etc) contains the original message (the one that triggered the error).

NOTE: Custom error handler is mutually exclusive with framework provided error handlers (i.e., logging error handler and binder specific error handler - see previous section) to ensure that they do not interfere. When you provide a custom error handler, sending failed messages to DLQ won't work even if it is configured to do so.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Consumer<ErrorMessage> myErrorHandler() {
	return v -> {
		// send SMS notification code
	};
}
----

To identify such consumer as an error handler all you need is to provide `error-handler-definition` property  pointing to the function name - `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<binding-name>.error-handler-definition=myErrorHandler`.

For example, for binding name `uppercase-in-0` the property would look like this:

[source,text]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.error-handler-definition=myErrorHandler
----
And if you used special mapping instruction to map binding to a more readable name - `spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.uppercase-in-0=upper`, then this property would look like this: 
[source,text]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.upper.error-handler-definition=myErrorHandler.
----

NOTE: If by accident you declare such handler as a `Function`, it will still work with the exception that nothing is going to be done with its output. However, given that such handler is still relying on functionality provided by Spring Cloud Function, you can also benefit from function composition in the event your handler has some complexity which you would like to address through function composition (however unlikely).


***Default Error Handler***

If you want to have a single error handler for all function beans, you can use the standard  spring-cloud-stream mechanism for defining default properties `spring.cloud.stream.default.error-handler-definition=myErrorHandler`


[[dlq-dead-letter-queue]]
== DLQ - Dead Letter Queue

Perhaps the most common mechanism, DLQ allows failed messages to be sent to a special destination: the _Dead Letter Queue_.

When configured, failed messages are sent to this destination for subsequent re-processing or auditing and reconciliation.

Consider the following example:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SimpleStreamApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		SpringApplication.run(SimpleStreamApplication.class,
		  "--spring.cloud.function.definition=uppercase",
		  "--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.destination=uppercase",
		  "--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.group=myGroup",
		  "--spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.uppercase-in-0.consumer.auto-bind-dlq=true"
		);
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<Person, Person> uppercase() {
		return personIn -> {
		   throw new RuntimeException("intentional");
	      });
		};
	}
}
----

As a reminder, in this example `uppercase-in-0` segment of the property corresponds to the name of the input destination binding.
The `consumer` segment indicates that it is a consumer property.

NOTE: When using DLQ, at least the `group` property must be provided for proper naming of the DLQ destination. However `group` is often used together
with `destination` property, as in our example.


Aside from some standard properties we also set the `auto-bind-dlq` to instruct the binder to create and configure DLQ destination for
`uppercase-in-0` binding which corresponds to `uppercase` destination (see corresponding property), which results in an additional Rabbit queue named `uppercase.myGroup.dlq` (see Kafka documentation for Kafka specific DLQ properties).

Once configured, all failed messages are routed to this destination preserving the original message for further actions.

And you can see that the error message contains more information relevant to the original error, as follows:

[source,text]
----
. . . .
x-exception-stacktrace:	org.springframework.messaging.MessageHandlingException: nested exception is
      org.springframework.messaging.MessagingException: has an error, failedMessage=GenericMessage [payload=byte[15],
      headers={amqp_receivedDeliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, amqp_receivedRoutingKey=input.hello, amqp_deliveryTag=1,
      deliveryAttempt=3, amqp_consumerQueue=input.hello, amqp_redelivered=false, id=a15231e6-3f80-677b-5ad7-d4b1e61e486e,
      amqp_consumerTag=amq.ctag-skBFapilvtZhDsn0k3ZmQg, contentType=application/json, timestamp=1522327846136}]
      at org.spring...integ...han...MethodInvokingMessageProcessor.processMessage(MethodInvokingMessageProcessor.java:107)
      at. . . . .
Payload: blah
----

You can also facilitate immediate dispatch to DLQ (without re-tries) by setting `max-attempts` to '1'. For example,
[source,text]
----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.consumer.max-attempts=1
----

[[retry-template]]
== Retry Template

In this section we cover configuration properties relevant to configuration of retry capabilities.

The `RetryTemplate` is part of the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] library.
While it is out of scope of this document to cover all of the capabilities of the `RetryTemplate`, we 
will mention the following consumer properties that are specifically related to
the `RetryTemplate`:

maxAttempts::
The number of attempts to process the message.
+
Default: 3. 
backOffInitialInterval::
The backoff initial interval on retry.
+
Default 1000 milliseconds.
backOffMaxInterval::
The maximum backoff interval.
+
Default 10000 milliseconds. 
backOffMultiplier::
The backoff multiplier.
+
Default 2.0.
defaultRetryable::
Whether exceptions thrown by the listener that are not listed in the `retryableExceptions` are retryable.
+
Default: `true`.
retryableExceptions::
A map of Throwable class names in the key and a boolean in the value.
Specify those exceptions (and subclasses) that will or won't be retried.
Also see `defaultRetriable`.
Example: `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.retryable-exceptions.java.lang.IllegalStateException=false`.
+
Default: empty.

While the preceding settings are sufficient for the majority of the customization requirements, they may not satisfy certain complex requirements, at which
point you may want to provide your own instance of the `RetryTemplate`. To do so configure it as a bean in your application configuration. The application provided
instance will override the one provided by the framework. Also, to avoid conflicts you must qualify the instance of the `RetryTemplate` you want to be used by the binder
as `@StreamRetryTemplate`. For example,

[source,java]
----
@StreamRetryTemplate
public RetryTemplate myRetryTemplate() {
    return new RetryTemplate();
}
----
As you can see from the above example you don't need to annotate it with `@Bean` since `@StreamRetryTemplate` is a qualified `@Bean`.

If you need to be more precise with your `RetryTemplate`, you can specify the bean by name in your `ConsumerProperties` to associate
the specific retry bean per binding.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<foo>.consumer.retry-template-name=<your-retry-template-bean-name>
----
