= RabbitMQ Producer Properties

The following properties are available for Rabbit producers only and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.<channelName>.producer.`.

However if the same set of properties needs to be applied to most bindings, to
avoid repetition, Spring Cloud Stream supports setting values for all channels,
in the format of `spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.default.<property>=<value>`.

Also, keep in mind that binding specific property will override its equivalent in the default.

altermateExchange.binding.queue::
If the exchange does not already exist, and a `name` is provided, bind this queue to the alternate exchange.
A simple durable queue with no arguments is provisioned; if more sophisticated configuration is required, you must configure and bind the queue yourself.
+
Default: `null`
alternateExchange.binding.routingKey
If the exchange does not already exist, and a `name` and `queue` is provided, bind the queue to the alternate exchange using this routing key.
+
Default: `#` (for the default `topic` alternate exchange)
alternateExchange.exists::
Whether the alternate exchange exists, or needs to be provisioned.
+
Default: `false`
alternateExchange.type::
If the alternate exchange does not already exist, the type of exchange to provision.

Default: `topic`
alternateExchange.name::
Configure an alternate exchange on the destination exchange.

batchingEnabled::
Whether to enable message batching by producers.
Messages are batched into one message according to the following properties (described in the next three entries in this list): 'batchSize', `batchBufferLimit`, and `batchTimeout`.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp//reference/html/_reference.html#template-batching[Batching] for more information.
Also see xref:rabbit/rabbit_overview/receiving-batch.adoc[Receiving Batched Messages].

Can be multiple keys - see `bindingRoutingKeyDelimiter`.
For partitioned destinations, `-n` is appended to each key.
Only applies if `requiredGroups` are provided and then only to those groups.
+
Default: `#`.
bindingRoutingKeyDelimiter::

NOTE: In the case of RabbitMQ, content type headers can be set by external applications.
Spring Cloud Stream supports them as part of an extended internal protocol used for any type of transport -- including transports, such as Kafka (prior to 0.11), that do not natively support headers.
