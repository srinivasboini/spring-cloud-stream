= RabbitMQ Consumer Properties

The following properties are available for Rabbit consumers only and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.<channelName>.consumer.`.

However if the same set of properties needs to be applied to most bindings, to
avoid repetition, Spring Cloud Stream supports setting values for all channels,
in the format of `spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.default.<property>=<value>`.

Also, keep in mind that binding specific property will override its equivalent in the default.

acknowledgeMode::
The acknowledge mode.
+
Default: `AUTO`.
anonymousGroupPrefix::
When the binding has no `group` property, an anonymous, auto-delete queue is bound to the destination exchange.
The default naming strategy for such queues results in a queue named `anonymous.<base64 representation of a UUID>`.
Set this property to change the prefix to something other than the default.
+
Default: `anonymous.`.
autoBindDlq::
Whether to automatically declare the DLQ and bind it to the binder DLX.
+
Default: `false`.
bindingRoutingKey::
The routing key with which to bind the queue to the exchange (if `bindQueue` is `true`).
Can be multiple keys - see `bindingRoutingKeyDelimiter`.
For partitioned destinations, `-<instanceIndex>` is appended to each key.
+
Default: `#`.
bindingRoutingKeyDelimiter::
When this is not null, 'bindingRoutingKey' is considered to be a list of keys delimited by this value; often a comma is used.
+
Default: `null`.
bindQueue::
Whether to declare the queue and bind it to the destination exchange.
Set it to `false` if you have set up your own infrastructure and have previously created and bound the queue.
+
Default: `true`.
consumerTagPrefix::
Used to create the consumer tag(s); will be appended by `#n` where `n` increments for each consumer created.
Example: `${spring.application.name}-${spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group}-${spring.cloud.stream.instance-index}`.
+
Default: none - the broker will generate random consumer tags.
containerType::
Select the type of listener container to be used.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/reference/html/_reference.html#choose-container[Choosing a Container] in the Spring AMQP documentation for more information.
Also see <<rabbitmq-stream>>.
+
Default: `simple`
deadLetterQueueName::
The name of the DLQ
+
Default: `prefix+destination.dlq`
deadLetterExchange::
A DLX to assign to the queue.
Relevant only if `autoBindDlq` is `true`.
+
Default: 'prefix+DLX'
deadLetterExchangeType::
The type of the DLX to assign to the queue.
Relevant only if `autoBindDlq` is `true`.
+
Default: 'direct'
deadLetterRoutingKey::
A dead letter routing key to assign to the queue.
Relevant only if `autoBindDlq` is `true`.
+
Default: `destination`
declareDlx::
Whether to declare the dead letter exchange for the destination.
Relevant only if `autoBindDlq` is `true`.
Set to `false` if you have a pre-configured DLX.
+
Default: `true`.
declareExchange::
Whether to declare the exchange for the destination.
+
Default: `true`.
delayedExchange::
Whether to declare the exchange as a `Delayed Message Exchange`.
Requires the delayed message exchange plugin on the broker.
The `x-delayed-type` argument is set to the `exchangeType`.
+
Default: `false`.
dlqBindingArguments::
Arguments applied when binding the dlq to the dead letter exchange; used with `headers` `deadLetterExchangeType` to specify headers to match on.
For example `...dlqBindingArguments.x-match=any`, `...dlqBindingArguments.someHeader=someValue`.
+
Default: empty
dlqDeadLetterExchange::
If a DLQ is declared, a DLX to assign to that queue.
+
Default: `none`
dlqDeadLetterRoutingKey::
If a DLQ is declared, a dead letter routing key to assign to that queue.
+
Default: `none`
dlqExpires::
How long before an unused dead letter queue is deleted (in milliseconds).
+
Default: `no expiration`
dlqLazy::
Declare the dead letter queue with the `x-queue-mode=lazy` argument.
See https://www.rabbitmq.com/lazy-queues.html["`Lazy Queues`"].
Consider using a policy instead of this setting, because using a policy allows changing the setting without deleting the queue.
+
Default: `false`.
dlqMaxLength::
Maximum number of messages in the dead letter queue.
+
Default: `no limit`
dlqMaxLengthBytes::
Maximum number of total bytes in the dead letter queue from all messages.

dlqMaxPriority::
Maximum priority of messages in the dead letter queue (0-255).
+
Default: `none`
dlqOverflowBehavior::
Action to take when `dlqMaxLength` or `dlqMaxLengthBytes` is exceeded; currently `drop-head` or `reject-publish` but refer to the RabbitMQ documentation.
+
Default: `none`
dlqQuorum.deliveryLimit::
When `quorum.enabled=true`, set a delivery limit after which the message is dropped or dead-lettered.
+
Default: none - broker default will apply.
dlqQuorum.enabled::
When true, create a quorum dead letter queue instead of a classic queue.
+
Default: false
dlqQuorum.initialGroupSize::
When `quorum.enabled=true`, set the initial quorum size.
+
Default: none - broker default will apply.
dlqSingleActiveConsumer::
Set to true to set the `x-single-active-consumer` queue property to true.
+
Default: `false`
dlqTtl::
Default time to live to apply to the dead letter queue when declared (in milliseconds).
+
Default: `no limit`
durableSubscription::
Whether the subscription should be durable.
Only effective if `group` is also set.
+
Default: `true`.
exchangeAutoDelete::
If `declareExchange` is true, whether the exchange should be auto-deleted (that is, removed after the last queue is removed).
+
Default: `true`.
exchangeDurable::
If `declareExchange` is true, whether the exchange should be durable (that is, it survives broker restart).
+
Default: `true`.
exchangeType::
The exchange type: `direct`, `fanout`, `headers` or `topic` for non-partitioned destinations and `direct`, headers or `topic` for partitioned destinations.
+
Default: `topic`.
exclusive::
Whether to create an exclusive consumer.
Concurrency should be 1 when this is `true`.
Often used when strict ordering is required but enabling a hot standby instance to take over after a failure.
See `recoveryInterval`, which controls how often a standby instance attempts to consume.
Consider using `singleActiveConsumer` instead when using RabbitMQ 3.8 or later.
+
Default: `false`.
expires::
How long before an unused queue is deleted (in milliseconds).
+
Default: `no expiration`
failedDeclarationRetryInterval::
The interval (in milliseconds) between attempts to consume from a queue if it is missing.
+
Default: 5000
[[spring-cloud-stream-rabbit-frame-max-headroom]]
frameMaxHeadroom::
The number of bytes to reserve for other headers when adding the stack trace to a DLQ message header.
All headers must fit within the `frame_max` size configured on the broker.
Stack traces can be large; if the size plus this property exceeds `frame_max` then the stack trace will be truncated.
A WARN log will be written; consider increasing the `frame_max` or reducing the stack trace by catching the exception and throwing one with a smaller stack trace.
+
Default: 20000
headerPatterns::
Patterns for headers to be mapped from inbound messages.
+
Default: `['*']` (all headers).
lazy::
Declare the queue with the `x-queue-mode=lazy` argument.
See https://www.rabbitmq.com/lazy-queues.html["`Lazy Queues`"].
Consider using a policy instead of this setting, because using a policy allows changing the setting without deleting the queue.
+
Default: `false`.
maxConcurrency::
The maximum number of consumers.
Not supported when the `containerType` is `direct`.
+
Default: `1`.
maxLength::
The maximum number of messages in the queue.
+
Default: `no limit`
maxLengthBytes::
The maximum number of total bytes in the queue from all messages.
+
Default: `no limit`
maxPriority::
The maximum priority of messages in the queue (0-255).
+
Default: `none`
missingQueuesFatal::
When the queue cannot be found, whether to treat the condition as fatal and stop the listener container.
Defaults to `false` so that the container keeps trying to consume from the queue -- for example, when using a cluster and the node hosting a non-HA queue is down.
+
Default: `false`
overflowBehavior::
Action to take when `maxLength` or `maxLengthBytes` is exceeded; currently `drop-head` or `reject-publish` but refer to the RabbitMQ documentation.
+
Default: `none`
prefetch::
Prefetch count.
+
Default: `1`.
prefix::
A prefix to be added to the name of the `destination` and queues.
+
Default: "".
queueBindingArguments::
Arguments applied when binding the queue to the exchange; used with `headers` `exchangeType` to specify headers to match on.
For example `...queueBindingArguments.x-match=any`, `...queueBindingArguments.someHeader=someValue`.
+
Default: empty
queueDeclarationRetries::
The number of times to retry consuming from a queue if it is missing.
Relevant only when `missingQueuesFatal` is `true`.
Otherwise, the container keeps retrying indefinitely.
Not supported when the `containerType` is `direct`.
+
Default: `3`
queueNameGroupOnly::
When true, consume from a queue with a name equal to the `group`.
Otherwise the queue name is `destination.group`.
This is useful, for example, when using Spring Cloud Stream to consume from an existing RabbitMQ queue.
+
Default: false.
quorum.deliveryLimit::
When `quorum.enabled=true`, set a delivery limit after which the message is dropped or dead-lettered.
+
Default: none - broker default will apply.
quorum.enabled::
When true, create a quorum queue instead of a classic queue.
+
Default: false
quorum.initialGroupSize::
When `quorum.enabled=true`, set the initial quorum size.
+
Default: none - broker default will apply.
recoveryInterval::
The interval between connection recovery attempts, in milliseconds.
+
Default: `5000`.
requeueRejected::
Whether delivery failures should be re-queued when retry is disabled or `republishToDlq` is `false`.
+
Default: `false`.
[[spring-cloud-stream-rabbit-republish-delivery-mode]]
republishDeliveryMode::
When `republishToDlq` is `true`, specifies the delivery mode of the republished message.
+
Default: `DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT`
republishToDlq::
By default, messages that fail after retries are exhausted are rejected.
If a dead-letter queue (DLQ) is configured, RabbitMQ routes the failed message (unchanged) to the DLQ.
If set to `true`, the binder republishs failed messages to the DLQ with additional headers, including the exception message and stack trace from the cause of the final failure.
Also see the xref:rabbit/rabbit_overview/rabbitmq-consumer-properties.adoc#spring-cloud-stream-rabbit-frame-max-headroom[frameMaxHeadroom property].
+
Default: `true`
singleActiveConsumer::
Set to true to set the `x-single-active-consumer` queue property to true.
+
Default: `false`
transacted::
Whether to use transacted channels.
+
Default: `false`.
ttl::
Default time to live to apply to the queue when declared (in milliseconds).
+
Default: `no limit`
txSize::
The number of deliveries between acks.
Not supported when the `containerType` is `direct`.
+
Default: `1`.
