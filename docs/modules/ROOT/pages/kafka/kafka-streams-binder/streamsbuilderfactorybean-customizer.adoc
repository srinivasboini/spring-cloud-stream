= StreamsBuilderFactoryBean configurer

It is often required to customize the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` that creates the `KafkaStreams` objects.
Based on the underlying support provided by Spring Kafka, the binder allows you to customize the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean`.
You can use the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer` to customize the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` itself.
Then, once you get access to the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` through this configurer, you can customize the corresponding `KafkaStreams` using `KafkaStreamsCustomzier`.
Both of these customizers are part of the Spring for Apache Kafka project.

Here is an example of using the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer`.

```
@Bean
public StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer streamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer() {
    return sfb -> sfb.setStateListener((newState, oldState) -> {
         //Do some action here!
    });
}
```

The above is shown as an illustration of the things you can do to customize the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean`.
You can essentially call any available mutation operations from `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` to customize it.
This customizer will be invoked by the binder right before the factory bean is started.

Once you get access to the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean`, you can also customize the underlying `KafkaStreams` object.
Here is a blueprint for doing so.

```
@Bean
public StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer streamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer() {
    return factoryBean -> {
        factoryBean.setKafkaStreamsCustomizer(new KafkaStreamsCustomizer() {
            @Override
            public void customize(KafkaStreams kafkaStreams) {
                kafkaStreams.setUncaughtExceptionHandler((t, e) -> {

                });
            }
        });
    };
}
```

`KafkaStreamsCustomizer` will be called by the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBeabn` right before the underlying `KafkaStreams` gets started.

There can only be one `StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer` in the entire application.
Then how do we account for multiple Kafka Streams processors as each of them are backed up by individual `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` objects?
In that case, if the customization needs to be different for those processors, then the application needs to apply some filter based on the application ID.

For e.g,

```
@Bean
public StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer streamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer() {
    return factoryBean -> {
        if (factoryBean.getStreamsConfiguration().getProperty(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG)
                .equals("processor1-application-id")) {
            factoryBean.setKafkaStreamsCustomizer(new KafkaStreamsCustomizer() {
                @Override
                public void customize(KafkaStreams kafkaStreams) {
                    kafkaStreams.setUncaughtExceptionHandler((t, e) -> {

                    });
                }
            });
        }
    };
```

[[using-configurer-to-register-a-global-state-store]]
== Using StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer to register a global state store

As mentioned above, the binder does not provide a first class way to register global state stores as a feature.
For that, you need to use the customizer via `StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer`.
Here is how that can be done.

```
@Bean
public StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer customizer() {
    return streamsBuilderFactoryBean -> {
        try {
            streamsBuilderFactoryBean.setInfrastructureCustomizer(new KafkaStreamsInfrastructureCustomizer() {
                  @Override
                  public void configureBuilder(StreamsBuilder builder) {
                      builder.addGlobalStore(
                              ...
                      );
                  }
              });
        }
        catch (Exception e) {

        }
    };
}
```

Any customizations on `StreamsBuilder` must be done through the `KafkaStreamsInfrastructureCustomizer` as shown above.
If `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean#getObject()` is called to get access to the `StreamsBuilder` object, that may not work as the bean maybe in initialization and thus run into some circular dependency issues.

If you have multiple processors, you want to attach the global state store to the right `StreamsBuilder` by filtering out the other `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` objects using the application id as outlined above.

[[using-configurer-to-register-a-production-exception-handler]]
== Using StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer to register a production exception handler

In the error handling section, we indicated that the binder does not provide a first class way to deal with production exceptions.
Though that is the case, you can still use the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` customizer to register production exception handlers. See below.

```
@Bean
public StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer configurer() {
    return fb -> {
        fb.getStreamsConfiguration().put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_PRODUCTION_EXCEPTION_HANDLER_CLASS_CONFIG,
                            CustomProductionExceptionHandler.class);
    };
}
```

Once again, if you have multiple processors, you may want to set it appropriately against the correct `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean`.
You may also add such production exception handlers using the configuration property (See below for more on that), but this is an option if you choose to go with a programmatic approach.
