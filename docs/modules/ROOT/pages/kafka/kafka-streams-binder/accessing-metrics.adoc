= Accessing Kafka Streams Metrics
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Streams binder provides Kafka Streams metrics which can be exported through a Micrometer `MeterRegistry`.

For Spring Boot version 2.2.x, the metrics support is provided through a custom Micrometer metrics implementation by the binder.
For Spring Boot version 2.3.x, the Kafka Streams metrics support is provided natively through Micrometer.

When accessing metrics through the Boot actuator endpoint, make sure to add `metrics` to the property `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include`.
Then you can access `/actuator/metrics` to get a list of all the available metrics, which then can be individually accessed through the same URI (`/actuator/metrics/<metric-name>`).
