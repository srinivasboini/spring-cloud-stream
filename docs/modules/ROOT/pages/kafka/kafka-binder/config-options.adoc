= Configuration Options

This section contains the configuration options used by the Apache Kafka binder.

For common configuration options and properties pertaining to the binder, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#binding-properties[binding properties] in core documentation.

[[kafka-binder-properties]]
== Kafka Binder Properties

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers::
A list of brokers to which the Kafka binder connects.
+
Default: `localhost`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.defaultBrokerPort::
`brokers` allows hosts specified with or without port information (for example, `host1,host2:port2`).
This sets the default port when no port is configured in the broker list.
+
Default: `9092`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration::
Key/Value map of client properties (both producers and consumer) passed to all clients created by the binder.
Due to the fact that these properties are used by both producers and consumers, usage should be restricted to common properties -- for example, security settings.
Unknown Kafka producer or consumer properties provided through this configuration are filtered out and not allowed to propagate.
Properties here supersede any properties set in boot.
+
Default: Empty map.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.consumerProperties::
Key/Value map of arbitrary Kafka client consumer properties.
In addition to support known Kafka consumer properties, unknown consumer properties are allowed here as well.
Properties here supersede any properties set in boot and in the `configuration` property above.
+
Default: Empty map.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.headers::
The list of custom headers that are transported by the binder.
Only required when communicating with older applications (<= 1.3.x) with a `kafka-clients` version < 0.11.0.0. Newer versions support headers natively.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.healthTimeout::
The time to wait to get partition information, in seconds.
Health reports as down if this timer expires.
+
Default: 60.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.requiredAcks::
The number of required acks on the broker.
See the Kafka documentation for the producer `acks` property.
+
Default: `1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.minPartitionCount::
Effective only if `autoCreateTopics` or `autoAddPartitions` is set.
The global minimum number of partitions that the binder configures on topics on which it produces or consumes data.
It can be superseded by the `partitionCount` setting of the producer or by the value of `instanceCount * concurrency` settings of the producer (if either is larger).
+
Default: `1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.producerProperties::
Key/Value map of arbitrary Kafka client producer properties.
In addition to support known Kafka producer properties, unknown producer properties are allowed here as well.
Properties here supersede any properties set in boot and in the `configuration` property above.
+
Default: Empty map.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.replicationFactor::
The replication factor of auto-created topics if `autoCreateTopics` is active.
Can be overridden on each binding.
+
NOTE: If you are using Kafka broker versions prior to 2.4, then this value should be set to at least `1`.
Starting with version 3.0.8, the binder uses `-1` as the default value, which indicates that the broker 'default.replication.factor' property will be used to determine the number of replicas.
Check with your Kafka broker admins to see if there is a policy in place that requires a minimum replication factor, if that's the case then, typically, the `default.replication.factor` will match that value and `-1` should be used, unless you need a replication factor greater than the minimum.
+
Default: `-1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoCreateTopics::
If set to `true`, the binder creates new topics automatically.
If set to `false`, the binder relies on the topics being already configured.
In the latter case, if the topics do not exist, the binder fails to start.
+
NOTE: This setting is independent of the `auto.create.topics.enable` setting of the broker and does not influence it.
If the server is set to auto-create topics, they may be created as part of the metadata retrieval request, with default broker settings.
+
Default: `true`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoAddPartitions::
If set to `true`, the binder creates new partitions if required.
If set to `false`, the binder relies on the partition size of the topic being already configured.
If the partition count of the target topic is smaller than the expected value, the binder fails to start.
+
Default: `false`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.transactionIdPrefix::
Enables transactions in the binder. See `transaction.id` in the Kafka documentation and https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/#transactions[Transactions] in the `spring-kafka` documentation.
When transactions are enabled, individual `producer` properties are ignored and all producers use the `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.*` properties.
+
Default `null` (no transactions)
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.*::
Global producer properties for producers in a transactional binder.
See `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.transactionIdPrefix` and <<kafka-producer-properties>> and the general producer properties supported by all binders.
+
Default: See individual producer properties.

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.headerMapperBeanName::
The bean name of a `KafkaHeaderMapper` used for mapping `spring-messaging` headers to and from Kafka headers.
Use this, for example, if you wish to customize the trusted packages in a `BinderHeaderMapper` bean that uses JSON deserialization for the headers.
If this custom `BinderHeaderMapper` bean is not made available to the binder using this property, then the binder will look for a header mapper bean with the name `kafkaBinderHeaderMapper` that is of type `BinderHeaderMapper` before falling back to a default `BinderHeaderMapper` created by the binder.
+
Default: none.

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.considerDownWhenAnyPartitionHasNoLeader::
Flag to set the binder health as `down`, when any partitions on the topic, regardless of the consumer that is receiving data from it, is found without a leader.
+
Default: `true`.

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.certificateStoreDirectory::
When the truststore or keystore certificate location is given as a non-local file system resource (resources supported by org.springframework.core.io.Resource e.g. CLASSPATH, HTTP, etc.),
the binder copies the resource from the path (which is convertible to org.springframework.core.io.Resource) to a location on the filesystem.
This is true for both broker level certificates (`ssl.truststore.location` and `ssl.keystore.location`) and certificates intended for schema registry (`schema.registry.ssl.truststore.location` and `schema.registry.ssl.keystore.location`).
Keep in mind that the truststore and keystore location paths must be provided under `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration...`.
For example, `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration.ssl.truststore.location`, `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration.schema.registry.ssl.truststore.location`, etc.
The file will be copied to the location specified as the value for this property which must be an existing directory on the filesystem that is writable by the process running the application.
If this value is not set and the certificate file is a non-local file system resource, then it will be copied to System's temp directory as returned by `System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")`.
This is also true, if this value is present, but the directory cannot be found on the filesystem or is not writable.
+
Default: none.

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.metrics.defaultOffsetLagMetricsEnabled::
When set to true, the offset lag metric of each consumer topic is computed whenever the metric is accessed.
When set to false only the periodically calculated offset lag is used.
+
Default: true

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.metrics.offsetLagMetricsInterval::
The interval in which the offset lag for each consumer topic is computed.
This value is used whenever `metrics.defaultOffsetLagMetricsEnabled` is disabled or its
computation is taking too long.
+
Default: 60 seconds

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.enableObservation::
Enable Micrometer observation registry on all the bindings in this binder.
+
Default: false

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.healthIndicatorConsumerGroup::
`KafkaHealthIndicator` metadata consumer `group.id`.
This consumer is used by the `HealthIndicator` to query the metadata about the topics in use.
+
Default: none.

[[kafka-consumer-properties]]
== Kafka Consumer Properties

The following properties are available for Kafka consumers only and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<channelName>.consumer.`.

NOTE: To avoid repetition, Spring Cloud Stream supports setting values for all channels, in the format of `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.default.consumer.<property>=<value>`.

admin.configuration::
Since version 2.1.1, this property is deprecated in favor of `topic.properties`, and support for it will be removed in a future version.

admin.replicas-assignment::
Since version 2.1.1, this property is deprecated in favor of `topic.replicas-assignment`, and support for it will be removed in a future version.

admin.replication-factor::
Since version 2.1.1, this property is deprecated in favor of `topic.replication-factor`, and support for it will be removed in a future version.

autoRebalanceEnabled::
When `true`, topic partitions is automatically rebalanced between the members of a consumer group.
When `false`, each consumer is assigned a fixed set of partitions based on `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex`.
This requires both the `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` properties to be set appropriately on each launched instance.
The value of the `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` property must typically be greater than 1 in this case.
+
Default: `true`.
ackEachRecord::
When `autoCommitOffset` is `true`, this setting dictates whether to commit the offset after each record is processed.
By default, offsets are committed after all records in the batch of records returned by `consumer.poll()` have been processed.
The number of records returned by a poll can be controlled with the `max.poll.records` Kafka property, which is set through the consumer `configuration` property.
Setting this to `true` may cause a degradation in performance, but doing so reduces the likelihood of redelivered records when a failure occurs.
Also, see the binder `requiredAcks` property, which also affects the performance of committing offsets.
This property is deprecated as of 3.1 in favor of using `ackMode`.
If the `ackMode` is not set and batch mode is not enabled, `RECORD` ackMode will be used.
+
Default: `false`.

autoCommitOffset::

Starting with version 3.1, this property is deprecated.
See `ackMode` for more details on alternatives.
Whether to autocommit offsets when a message has been processed.
If set to `false`, a header with the key `kafka_acknowledgment` of the type `org.springframework.kafka.support.Acknowledgment` header is present in the inbound message.
Applications may use this header for acknowledging messages.
See the examples section for details.
When this property is set to `false`, Kafka binder sets the ack mode to `org.springframework.kafka.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer.AckMode.MANUAL` and the application is responsible for acknowledging records.
Also see `ackEachRecord`.
+
Default: `true`.
ackMode::
Specify the container ack mode.
This is based on the AckMode enumeration defined in Spring Kafka.
If `ackEachRecord` property is set to `true` and consumer is not in batch mode, then this will use the ack mode of `RECORD`, otherwise, use the provided ack mode using this property.

autoCommitOnError::
In pollable consumers, if set to `true`, it always auto commits on error.
If not set (the default) or false, it will not auto commit in pollable consumers.
Note that this property is only applicable for pollable consumers.
+
Default: not set.
resetOffsets::
Whether to reset offsets on the consumer to the value provided by startOffset.
Must be false if a `KafkaBindingRebalanceListener` is provided; see xref:kafka/kafka-binder/rebalance_listener.adoc[rebalance listener]
See xref:kafka/kafka-binder/reset-offsets.adoc[reset-offsets] for more information about this property.
+
Default: `false`.
startOffset::
The starting offset for new groups.
Allowed values: `earliest` and `latest`.
If the consumer group is set explicitly for the consumer 'binding' (through `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.group`), 'startOffset' is set to `earliest`. Otherwise, it is set to `latest` for the `anonymous` consumer group.
See xref:kafka/kafka-binder/reset-offsets.adoc[reset-offsets] for more information about this property.
+
Default: null (equivalent to `earliest`).
enableDlq::
When set to true, it enables DLQ behavior for the consumer.
By default, messages that result in errors are forwarded to a topic named `error.<destination>.<group>`.
The DLQ topic name can be configurable by setting the `dlqName` property or by defining a `@Bean` of type `DlqDestinationResolver`.
This provides an alternative option to the more common Kafka replay scenario for the case when the number of errors is relatively small and replaying the entire original topic may be too cumbersome.
See xref:kafka/kafka-binder/dlq.adoc[kafka dlq processing] for more information.
Starting with version 2.0, messages sent to the DLQ topic are enhanced with the following headers: `x-original-topic`, `x-exception-message`, and `x-exception-stacktrace` as `byte[]`.
By default, a failed record is sent to the same partition number in the DLQ topic as the original record.
See  xref:kafka/kafka-binder/dlq-partition.adoc[dlq partition selection] for how to change that behavior.
**Not allowed when `destinationIsPattern` is `true`.**
+
Default: `false`.
dlqPartitions::
When `enableDlq` is true, and this property is not set, a dead letter topic with the same number of partitions as the primary topic(s) is created.
Usually, dead-letter records are sent to the same partition in the dead-letter topic as the original record.
This behavior can be changed; see xref:kafka/kafka-binder/dlq-partition.adoc[dlq partition selection].
If this property is set to `1` and there is no `DqlPartitionFunction` bean, all dead-letter records will be written to partition `0`.
If this property is greater than `1`, you **MUST** provide a `DlqPartitionFunction` bean.
Note that the actual partition count is affected by the binder's `minPartitionCount` property.
+
Default: `none`
configuration::
Map with a key/value pair containing generic Kafka consumer properties.
In addition to having Kafka consumer properties, other configuration properties can be passed here.
For example some properties needed by the application such as `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.input.consumer.configuration.foo=bar`.
The `bootstrap.servers` property cannot be set here; use multi-binder support if you need to connect to multiple clusters.
+
Default: Empty map.
dlqName::
The name of the DLQ topic to receive the error messages.
+
Default: null (If not specified, messages that result in errors are forwarded to a topic named `error.<destination>.<group>`).
dlqProducerProperties::
Using this, DLQ-specific producer properties can be set.
All the properties available through kafka producer properties can be set through this property.
When native decoding is enabled on the consumer (i.e., useNativeDecoding: true) , the application must provide corresponding key/value serializers for DLQ.
This must be provided in the form  of `dlqProducerProperties.configuration.key.serializer` and `dlqProducerProperties.configuration.value.serializer`.
+
Default: Default Kafka producer properties.
standardHeaders::
Indicates which standard headers are populated by the inbound channel adapter.
Allowed values: `none`, `id`, `timestamp`, or `both`.
Useful if using native deserialization and the first component to receive a message needs an `id` (such as an aggregator that is configured to use a JDBC message store).
+
Default: `none`
converterBeanName::
The name of a bean that implements `RecordMessageConverter`. Used in the inbound channel adapter to replace the default `MessagingMessageConverter`.
+
Default: `null`
idleEventInterval::
The interval, in milliseconds, between events indicating that no messages have recently been received.
Use an `ApplicationListener<ListenerContainerIdleEvent>` to receive these events.
See xref:kafka/kafka-binder/pause_resume.adoc[pause-resume] for a usage example.
+
Default: `30000`
destinationIsPattern::
When true, the destination is treated as a regular expression `Pattern` used to match topic names by the broker.
When true, topics are not provisioned, and `enableDlq` is not allowed, because the binder does not know the topic names during the provisioning phase.
Note, the time taken to detect new topics that match the pattern is controlled by the consumer property `metadata.max.age.ms`, which (at the time of writing) defaults to 300,000ms (5 minutes).
This can be configured using the `configuration` property above.
+
Default: `false`
topic.properties::
A `Map` of Kafka topic properties used when provisioning new topics -- for example, `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.input.consumer.topic.properties.message.format.version=0.9.0.0`
+
Default: none.
topic.replicas-assignment::
A Map<Integer, List<Integer>> of replica assignments, with the key being the partition and the value being the assignments.
Used when provisioning new topics.
See the `NewTopic` Javadocs in the `kafka-clients` jar.
+
Default: none.
topic.replication-factor::
The replication factor to use when provisioning topics. Overrides the binder-wide setting.
Ignored if `replicas-assignments` is present.
+
Default: none (the binder-wide default of -1 is used).
pollTimeout::
Timeout used for polling in pollable consumers.
+
Default: 5 seconds.
transactionManager::
Bean name of a `KafkaAwareTransactionManager` used to override the binder's transaction manager for this binding.
Usually needed if you want to synchronize another transaction with the Kafka transaction, using the `ChainedKafkaTransactionManaager`.
To achieve exactly once consumption and production of records, the consumer and producer bindings must all be configured with the same transaction manager.
+
Default: none.
txCommitRecovered::
When using a transactional binder, the offset of a recovered record (e.g. when retries are exhausted and the record is sent to a dead letter topic) will be committed via a new transaction, by default.
Setting this property to `false` suppresses committing the offset of recovered record.
+
Default: true.
commonErrorHandlerBeanName::
`CommonErrorHandler` bean name to use per consumer binding.
When present, this user provided `CommonErrorHandler` takes precedence over any other error handlers defined by the binder.
This is a handy way to express error handlers, if the application does not want to use a `ListenerContainerCustomizer` and then check the destination/group combination to set an error handler.
+
Default: none.

[[kafka-producer-properties]]
== Kafka Producer Properties

The following properties are available for Kafka producers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<channelName>.producer.`.

NOTE: To avoid repetition, Spring Cloud Stream supports setting values for all channels, in the format of `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.default.producer.<property>=<value>`.

admin.configuration::
Since version 2.1.1, this property is deprecated in favor of `topic.properties`, and support for it will be removed in a future version.

admin.replicas-assignment::
Since version 2.1.1, this property is deprecated in favor of `topic.replicas-assignment`, and support for it will be removed in a future version.

admin.replication-factor::
Since version 2.1.1, this property is deprecated in favor of `topic.replication-factor`, and support for it will be removed in a future version.

bufferSize::
Upper limit, in bytes, of how much data the Kafka producer attempts to batch before sending.
+
Default: `16384`.
sync::
Whether the producer is synchronous.
+
Default: `false`.
sendTimeoutExpression::
A SpEL expression evaluated against the outgoing message used to evaluate the time to wait for ack when synchronous publish is enabled -- for example, `headers['mySendTimeout']`.
The value of the timeout is in milliseconds.
With versions before 3.0, the payload could not be used unless native encoding was being used because, by the time this expression was evaluated, the payload was already in the form of a `byte[]`.
Now, the expression is evaluated before the payload is converted.
+
Default: `none`.
batchTimeout::
How long the producer waits to allow more messages to accumulate in the same batch before sending the messages.
(Normally, the producer does not wait at all and simply sends all the messages that accumulated while the previous send was in progress.) A non-zero value may increase throughput at the expense of latency.
+
Default: `0`.
messageKeyExpression::
A SpEL expression evaluated against the outgoing message used to populate the key of the produced Kafka message -- for example, `headers['myKey']`.
With versions before 3.0, the payload could not be used unless native encoding was being used because, by the time this expression was evaluated, the payload was already in the form of a `byte[]`.
Now, the expression is evaluated before the payload is converted.
In the case of a regular processor (`Function<String, String>` or `Function<Message<?>, Message<?>`), if the produced key needs to be same as the incoming key from the topic, this property can be set as below.
`spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<output-binding-name>.producer.messageKeyExpression: headers['kafka_receivedMessageKey']`
There is an important caveat to keep in mind for reactive functions.
In that case, it is up to the application to manually copy the headers from the incoming messages to outbound messages.
You can set the header, e.g. `myKey` and use `headers['myKey']` as suggested above or, for convenience, simply set the `KafkaHeaders.MESSAGE_KEY` header, and you do not need to set this property at all.
+
Default: `none`.
headerPatterns::
A comma-delimited list of simple patterns to match Spring messaging headers to be mapped to the Kafka `Headers` in the `ProducerRecord`.
Patterns can begin or end with the wildcard character (asterisk).
Patterns can be negated by prefixing with `!`.
Matching stops after the first match (positive or negative).
For example `!ask,as*` will pass `ash` but not `ask`.
`id` and `timestamp` are never mapped.
+
Default: `*` (all headers - except the `id` and `timestamp`)
configuration::
Map with a key/value pair containing generic Kafka producer properties.
The `bootstrap.servers` property cannot be set here; use multi-binder support if you need to connect to multiple clusters.
+
Default: Empty map.
topic.properties::
A `Map` of Kafka topic properties used when provisioning new topics -- for example, `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.output.producer.topic.properties.message.format.version=0.9.0.0`
+
topic.replicas-assignment::
A Map<Integer, List<Integer>> of replica assignments, with the key being the partition and the value being the assignments.
Used when provisioning new topics.
See the `NewTopic` Javadocs in the `kafka-clients` jar.
+
Default: none.
topic.replication-factor::
The replication factor to use when provisioning topics. Overrides the binder-wide setting.
Ignored if `replicas-assignments` is present.
+
Default: none (the binder-wide default of -1 is used).
useTopicHeader::
Set to `true` to override the default binding destination (topic name) with the value of the `KafkaHeaders.TOPIC` message header in the outbound message.
If the header is not present, the default binding destination is used.
+
Default: `false`.
recordMetadataChannel::
The bean name of a `MessageChannel` to which successful send results should be sent; the bean must exist in the application context.
The message sent to the channel is the sent message (after conversion, if any) with an additional header `KafkaHeaders.RECORD_METADATA`.
The header contains a `RecordMetadata` object provided by the Kafka client; it includes the partition and offset where the record was written in the topic.
+
`ResultMetadata meta = sendResultMsg.getHeaders().get(KafkaHeaders.RECORD_METADATA, RecordMetadata.class)`
+
Failed sends go the producer error channel (if configured); see xref:kafka/kafka-binder/error-channels.adoc[Kafka error channels].
+
Default: null.

NOTE: The Kafka binder uses the `partitionCount` setting of the producer as a hint to create a topic with the given partition count (in conjunction with the `minPartitionCount`, the maximum of the two being the value being used).
Exercise caution when configuring both `minPartitionCount` for a binder and `partitionCount` for an application, as the larger value is used.
If a topic already exists with a smaller partition count and `autoAddPartitions` is disabled (the default), the binder fails to start.
If a topic already exists with a smaller partition count and `autoAddPartitions` is enabled, new partitions are added.
If a topic already exists with a larger number of partitions than the maximum of (`minPartitionCount` or `partitionCount`), the existing partition count is used.

compression::
Set the `compression.type` producer property.
Supported values are `none`, `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4` and `zstd`.
If you override the `kafka-clients` jar to 2.1.0 (or later), as discussed in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.2.x/reference/html/#deps-for-21x[Spring for Apache Kafka documentation], and wish to use `zstd` compression, use `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.producer.configuration.compression.type=zstd`.
+
Default: `none`.
transactionManager::
Bean name of a `KafkaAwareTransactionManager` used to override the binder's transaction manager for this binding.
Usually needed if you want to synchronize another transaction with the Kafka transaction, using the `ChainedKafkaTransactionManaager`.
To achieve exactly once consumption and production of records, the consumer and producer bindings must all be configured with the same transaction manager.
+
Default: none.

closeTimeout::
Timeout in number of seconds to wait for when closing the producer.
+
Default: `30`

allowNonTransactional::
Normally, all output bindings associated with a transactional binder will publish in a new transaction, if one is not already in process.
This property allows you to override that behavior.
If set to true, records published to this output binding will not be run in a transaction, unless one is already in process.
+
Default: `false`
